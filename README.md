# Final Project for Data Analyst Training by Correlation One

As part of my job-insertion plan in the US workforce, I identified the fundamental skillset I can apply in different areas.
  
One of the things I enjoy the most is finding patterns in data using several tools, from visualization to modeling. However, being an alien in the country, lack of networking, and having no clue about the job expectations in the data analytics field, I found that it is crucial to understand the workflow better.

Therefore, I decided to come back to training. I was accepted in the Data Analytics course given by [Correlation One](https://www.correlation-one.com/), which besides allowed me to brush up on using technical tools like Advanced Excel techniques, Python, SQL, and Tableau. Moreover, I've got used to working remotely with different people and learning about job search preparation.

In this repository, I share the journey of working on my capstone project, which required getting a certificate in Data Analytics.

In summary, the project title was: _Could rising gross rental costs drive the US graduate population homeless?_ and the main goal was to create a data-driven visualization tool that would help to answer that business question.
